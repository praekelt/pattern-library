Sometimes people write things that are offensive. When you report a comment you’re taken to another screen that provides you with a list of options as to why the comment was reported:


Racist remarks
Sexist remarks
Swearing
Etc.


We use the reporting functionality in two ways:
--

A moderator is made aware of comments that are reported, and can decided to moderate the comment.
We set an automatic moderation threshold, if a comment is reported 3 times then it’s automatically moderated.
