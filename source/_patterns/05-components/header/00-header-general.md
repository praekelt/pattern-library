The majority of our headers follow two styles:
--

Logo to the left, 3 main navigation links to the right: Search, User tools, and Menu.
Logo centered, main navigation links below and centered: Typically used when we have more than the 3 main links.

The 3 main navigation links that we place in the header are Search, User Tools (Log In, Register, Profile), and Menu.
We’re able to differentiate between the header on different pages, so it’s not uncommon to see a bigger logo on the homepage, and a smaller logo on subsequent pages. (section list, page, etc.)
