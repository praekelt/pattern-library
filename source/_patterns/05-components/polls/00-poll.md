The poll is broken down into three parts:
--

1. The question itself: “Do you love bananas?”
2. The user interaction part: (the type of poll)

- Choice Type: Allows the user to pick 1 or multiple choices.
- Text Entry: You’re asked a question, and the user types in an answer.

3. Submit button, results button (if a choice type), or the user is prompted to login, or register an account.


I’ve noticed that we’ve often named this button “vote,” which doesn’t make a lot of sense in the text entry context.
Why do you have the results on a new page? Is it possible to keep it in-line?


To note
--

The the call to action button e.g. 'Vote' used appropriately and can it also be left out to the editor?

- Editors use this feature for different things. Some for collecting user data e.g. demographics and other people use it for engagement /fun (e.g. What is your favourite colour).
- We need to find a word that suits both scenarios and 'Submit' sounds too formal for this.
- Several words options needs to be decided upon beforehand because of language translations and given to client to choose
