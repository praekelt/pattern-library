Registration requires the user to enter a username and a password.
Many of our users do not have email addresses; so we do not have that as an option for resetting a password.

Resetting a password via a mobile number is probably the easiest, but can be very expensive for the owner of the website.
My guess is that some site owners also don’t want to collect mobile numbers for privacy reasons.

Q: "Why would someone ever have to comment with their real name? Could we explain with sign-up that the Username needs to be unrecognizable to people who know them and explain why people’s identities are kept secret. That way we don’t need the “Comment Anonymously” functionality.  
Why? You end up with a lot of comments by “Anonymous” which does not make engaging with other users very appealing .
