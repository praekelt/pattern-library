Because we cannot always include an image with each article teaser, to support text scanning, place the thumbnails on the right.

In the code the category will need to be placed below the title - better for accessibility.

On very small screens (smaller than 240px) itâ€™s better to hide images in teasers.
However the hero teaser component's image can still be displayed.
