The composition of a comment can vary based on 3 things:
--

1. The comment is submitted by a user.
2. The comment is submitted by a staff member (should be visually different.)
3. The comment was removed by a staff member/ reported more than 5 times and automatically removed: A message will be displayed stating that “the comment has been removed.”


A comment contains the following:
--
Author: Nickname / Anonymous (If no nickname is supplied.).

A lot of our users are children, so we never show a username/ email address or phone number in the comment screen. Privacy protection is important.

Because we’re dealing with phones we usually don’t show more than 10 comments at a time; we include comment pagination to view older comments.
