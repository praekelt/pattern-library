Typically you’ll see anything from 2 to 5 languages,
but it’s also not uncommon to see as much as 9 different languages.

The position of the language selection list is usually at the top of the page to
allow foreign speakers  to rapidly identify and switch to a mother tongue.
Once a user has selected a language they’ll always see the site in that language
when they revisit. (Unless they’ve deleted their cookies, or are browsing in a private mode.


The list of languages are visually separated with a detail, or whitespace. (we use a css property called “:after” to achieve this, so it requires some CSS support.)
The active language (the language in use) should be displayed less prominently than the other languages.
