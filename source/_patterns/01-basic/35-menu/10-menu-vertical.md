title: "Navigation - Above Footer Section Method"
state: "inprogress"

The menu will be located in the footer, so when the user taps the Menu link in the header they jump down to the bottom of the page.

Problem

This may not be an ideal approach because the user “jumps around” and could feel lost, additionally the menu is at the bottom of the page, so the user would have to wait for the entire page to load in order to navigate further, tapping the menu link when the whole page hasn’t loaded wouldn’t do anything, so the site may appear broken.
