Users navigate through a site using links but not all links are conceptually the same
Normal text links are for navigating and do not have any side-effects, they are simply for navigation from page to page

Other links are used to create a specific effect such as starting/ending a process or committing something to a database. Such links are action important because they can cause side-effects that cannot be undone easily.

The visual difference of importance is critical in order to prompt users or action e.g. Profiles login or Signup
